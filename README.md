This is a simple Breakout game written entirely in pure JavaScript and rendered on HTML5 &lt;canvas&gt;.

Breakout is a game where you control a paddle at the bottom of the screen, and you use it to hit a ball upwards to break bricks. The goal is to break all the bricks, and not let the ball through the ground too many times.
